Official templates for Spin.

## Guidelines

The official templates are high-quality templates that are ready for the real world
Here are some guidelines that we follow when creating a template:

- Offer a Reason and OCaml version
- Provide a CI/CD for at least Github Actions and Azure
- Create real unit tests and integration tests
- Include documentation generation from markdown and code
- Deploy release artifact (e.g. Docker images, binaries, static web files, etc.)
